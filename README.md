# foodkiosk

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

For some reason, there is a bug on the build release file, so please install the debug release file on
the android device to see it works properly.

Foodkiosk.apk (22.0MB)    vs   Foodkiosk-debug.apk (81.2MB)

I'll be fixing the build release and update the release on the google drive.

To use this .apk file:

1. Download the "Foodkiosk-debug.apk" file on any android ONLY device.
2. Install it. Make sure your device support external installation from unknown device.
3. Click the app and run.
