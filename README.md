For some reason, there is a bug on the build release file, so please install the debug release file on
the android device to see it works properly.

The differences:
Foodkiosk.apk (22.0MB)    vs   Foodkiosk-debug.apk (81.2MB)

I'll be fixing the build release and update the release on the google drive.

To download the .apk file, click the gdrive link here:
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L5g9hRYoXyv_6lqdkprDG0AAtd9V_zSM?usp=sharing

To use this .apk file:

1. Download the "Foodkiosk-debug.apk" file on any android ONLY device.
2. Install it. Make sure your device support external installation from unknown device.
3. Click the app and run.
